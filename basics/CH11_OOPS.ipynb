    "-OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into       individual objects.\n",

Classes also have special functions, called methods, that define         behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data. While the class is the blueprint, an     instance is an object built from a class that contains real data\n",
    "\n",
    "-To define the properties, or instance attributes, that all (here, Vehicle) objects must have, you need to define a special       method called .__init__().This method is run every time a new Vehicle object is created and tells Python what the initial       state—that is, the initial values of the object should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "-The first positional argument of .__init__() is always a variable that references the class instance. This variable is           universally named self. After the self argument, you can specify any other arguments required to create an instance of the       class.\n",
